# Pokemon Rolodex
This application is a Pokemon Rolodex that displays a list of Pokémon fetched from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Users can filter the Pokémon by name using the search box. The app demonstrates core React concepts including:

- A form for user input (search functionality)
- Data fetching via the Fetch API inside a lifecycle method (`componentDidMount`)
- A component-based architecture using props to pass data
- Attractive styling using CSS and Google Fonts

## Features
- **Search Form:** Filter Pokémon by name.
- **External Data:** Fetch data from the PokeAPI.
- **Lifecycle Methods:** Use `componentDidMount` to load data.
- **Reusable Components:** Built with CardList, Card, and SearchBox components.
- **Responsive Styling:** Custom CSS with a Google Font and background gradient.
- **Deployment:** Deployed online (via GitHub Pages) and the code is maintained in a Git repository.
